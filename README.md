# Snap-
A simple Java snap game

A snap game is simulated between two players using standard playing card decks.


• The application asks the user how many playing card decks to play with
• The application asks the user whether cards should be matched: on suit, value, or both
• The application shuffles the decks before play commences
• Games of snap is then be simulated between players. Cards are played one at a time in
order by each player in the game, onto their stack. When a player deals a card that matches a
card at the top of another player's stack, the first player to 'shout' snap 'takes' the two piles.
• The stop condition can be either after the first round when all cards were dealt, with the winner
being the player who scored more cards.
